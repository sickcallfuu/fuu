Added some new Elden Ring and Dark Souls drawings to the galleries... all are explicit so heads up!
- 3 new drawings under [R-18 Elden Ring](/er_r18) ***NSFW!***
- 1 new drawing under [R-18 Dark Souls](/ds_r18) ***NSFW!***

All fullsized images have their own pages now too and I've included the drawing media and notes (if there are any) on there.

Some miscellaneous pics:

This is one of the in progress drawings I posted in the last post (still not done.) I was making copies of the main drawing layer before doing any drastic changes and this is just all the different states of the drawing overlaid on top of each other.

Rogier's outfit has capelet (?) that buttons in the back worn over a jerkin/jacket/whatever that buttons in the front. It makes drawing him in various states of undress sort of tricky... Maybe it's just me but I struggle figuring it out. This was a crappy sketch made while working on [this drawing](/er_r18/2025/ring/).
