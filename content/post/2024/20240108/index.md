Shifted things around a little and tried to make the layout nicer (made it pink, maybe subconciously thinking about Valentine's Day approaching.)

🌫️ Added 1 drawing under [Elden Ring](/eldenring/), made on Christmas Day:
{{<img src="/eldenring/img/2024-01-01-0009.png" alt="fret" caption="Fret" width="500">}}

🌫️ Made separate page for [Comics](/pages/comics/), added 4 page excerpt from a 12-page comic called [A God for Every Metal](/pages/comics/agodforeverymetal/) that I made for an anthology recently. Should be published this year but not sure when. After it's out I'll add the rest of the comic here.
{{<img src="/comics/agodforeverymetal/agodforeverymetal_003.png" alt="A God for Every Metal, page 3" caption="A God for Every Metal, page 3" width="500">}}
Also added 2 of these pages under Elden Ring drawings, I'm not sure if I'll keep them there.

🌫️ Couple of states of an in-progress drawing started in December:
{{<img src="/images/2024/rog_20231211_1.png" alt="in progress deathblight 1" caption="rog_20231211_1.png">}}
{{<img src="/images/2024/rog_20231211_2.png" alt="in progress deathblight 2" caption="rog_20231211_2.png">}}

🌫️ Might make separate section to collect in progress shots and sketches.
