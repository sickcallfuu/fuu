updates 🌚 
Added some drawings to [Elden Ring](/eldenring) gallery, some new stuff and a few older drawings.

Added the entirety of [A God For Every Metal](/comics/agodforeverymetal/) under comics. I had only the first 4 pages posted originally, which is kind of stupid as an excerpt because the whole thing is only 12 pages. This has been done since December 2023 but it was printed just recently in [Lagon Revue's 7th issue, PLUIE](http://revuelagon.com/pluie/).

[Half Gold/Half Dung](https://www.breakdownpress.com/store/half-gold-half-dung-by-margot-ferrick)

Breakdown Press is publishing a short collection of a bunch of the Fromsoft fanart I've drawn. It's about 70 pages. Comes out August 18th but is available for pre-order. It also includes the short Solaire comic posted here under Comics.

Added a section called [heap](/heap) to the menu. It just automatically collects all the images posted in the blog section of the site... I was really attached to this idea several months ago but now I'm not sure about it. I'll keep it around for a while. I'd like to post more scraps or sketches here and thought it would be satisfying to have a gallery of those.

to do:
- collection of screenshots
- would like to use this more like a blog maybe
- section for commissions done a while ago
