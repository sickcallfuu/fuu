# hello ~
Moved to: [fuu.margot.maison](https://fuu.margot.maison)
 which should be the page you're on right now. I won't be renewing the domain fuu.ooo after Jan 19th.

# some stuff on pixiv
{{<img src="/images/2024/spillcrop.png" alt="cropped version of a drawing of Rogier and D.">}}

You'll need to be logged into Pixiv to see these because they're R-18:
- [A few drawings from November - December 2024](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/125772847)
- [Late summer - early fall dump](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/121661533)

I'll try to add these to this site too later.
