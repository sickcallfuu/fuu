# new drawings
Added a new section for some of the more explicit Elden Ring drawings I did last year. These have been on pixiv for a while. The drawing above is over there, though it's just sort of suggestive (I drew this on my birthday last year.) Sometimes I don't know how to decide what's what. 

Anyway, here it is: [!Explicit stuff](/exp/)


# other site updates
Changed the layout a bit and cleaned up some stuff, maybe it's not that noticable. Site uses [magick.css](https://css.winterveil.net/) now.

## rss
[New link for rss feed...](https://fuu.margot.maison/index.xml)

## favicon
Not interesting but finally updated the favicon for this site.
