<p>ink, pencil, colored pencil on paper + Clip Studio Paint</p>
<p><i>I think this was made during a time when I wanted to learn how to get better at making digital art but I just
        couldn't figure it out. I kept scanning these partly finished drawings and tried to draw over them in Clip
        Studio (the green area and some other details on the outfit were done digitally...) A lot of these didn't turn
        out too well. I'm not sure where the original drawing for this is anymore.</i></p>
