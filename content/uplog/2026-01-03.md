- some minor layout changes
- changed this update log so that it has separate entries instead of one page
- updated blog with drawing from an in progress comic (very NSFW)

in progress...
- the galleries are sort of inconsistent... i'll fix this soon. for now some of them have pages for images and some of them just open the url for the full sized image.

to do
- add rss feed for these update posts
- fix gallery pages...make actual thumbnail images, fix layout shift
