For some reason I thought the description of Ciaran's helmet in game was inplying that the blonde hair was part of
the helmet and not actually Ciaran's own hair. I started imagining her as having very short, dark hair and got
attached to this version of her. Someone on tumblr told me that the original Japanese description makes it
 clearer that she does indeed have long, blonde hair though...
