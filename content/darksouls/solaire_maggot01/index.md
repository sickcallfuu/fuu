Drawn in the same sketchbook as the Ciaran drawing from this same year. This gesture of holding the sword by the
blade was taken from the ballet Giselle, where the main character drags a sword around as she goes insane...
though in the specific performance I was thinking of (starring Galina Ulonova in the 60's?) she holds the sword
by the very tip and drags it along the ground.
